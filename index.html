	<h1>This is the CS284 Final Project</h1>
	<p>Potential Ideas:
		Would an interactive boids/flock simulation of humans during Covid be a valid CS284A topic idea? We’re thinking
		we’d allow users to change “separation” (due to Covid), and perhaps naively label people as Covid positive if
		they come within 6 feet? As a stretch goal we could include a secondary level of particle simulation for Covid
		particles emitting from people (though we admittedly know very little about how Covid physically spreads). We
		could change the size, velocity, and etc of the Covid particles to better visualize the effect. The final
		deliverable could be used as a tool to study/present the covid spread in different settings (in-doors, outdoors,
		how many people in the room, distance between people, mask or unmasked).
		Boids, specifically maybe we can improve upon Crowd Simulation and make it faster/more efficient?

		Title, Summary and Team Members
		Provide us a descriptive title, 2-3 sentences that summarize your project, and list your three team members.
		Title: Covid Spread Visualization
		Summary: We’re attempting to create an interactive visualization of how Covid particles are physically spread
		through the air under different conditions. We’ll then potentially additionally do human crowd (2D boids)
		simulation on top of that to see how different conditions in people “pathing” (specifically separation) affect
		Covid spread.
		Team Members: Richard Wang, Jordan Wong, Yi-Chen Chen, Weiyu Feng
		Problem Description
		Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is
		important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.
		We’ll be trying to make a physically accurate simulation of how Covid particles spread and ideally do it in real
		time so that users can interact with it by changing conditions (masks, wind, humidity, ventilation). This will
		require an efficient particle simulation algorithm, and especially so if we make it in 3D instead of 2D.
		Depending on how much time we have left, we’ll then add an additional layer of complexity by incorporating human
		crowds (2D boids) on top of the cough simulation.
		Although it may not be 100% accurate to real life, our final deliverable could be used as a tool to
		study/present the covid spread in different settings.
		The biggest challenge will likely be getting this all to run in real time at a reasonable frame rate. We’ll
		likely need to do some simplifications if we can’t figure out ways to optimize our algorithms
		Goals and Deliverables
		This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to
		accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
		Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo
		of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
		If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
		Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or
		quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage
		you to try.
		What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
		You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In
		(1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect
		(i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you
		hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).
		Plan To Deliver:
		2D Cough Particle Simulation
		Measure framerate for different optimizations?
		Interactive 2D Cough Particle Simulation
		With/without mask
		wind?
		Air Temperature/humidity
		Ventilation/no ventilation
		Interactive 3D Cough Particle Simulation
		Hope To Deliver:
		Interactive Human Crowd (2D Boids) Simulation
		Separation
		Alignment
		Cohesion
		Naive “Coloring/Labeling” of Covid Infected people
		Interactive Human Crowd (2D Boids) Simulation + 3D Cough Particle Simulation
		“Coloring/Labeling” of Covid infected people touched by particles
		Schedule
		In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since
		presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.
		Week 1 (4/11) - research/start implementation
		2D Cough Particle Simulation
		Week 2 (4/18) - rough implementation
		Finalize 2D Cough Particle Simulation
		Build basic interactive interfaces
		Week 3 (4/25) - stretch goals / finalizing report
		Interactive 3D Cough Particle Simulation
		Add more features in the interfaces
		Interactive Human Crowd (2D Boids) Simulation
		Integrate both Human Crowd Simulation and Cough Simulations
		Week 4 (5/2) - presentation week
		Resources
		Hardware: our own machines
		Software: Unity
